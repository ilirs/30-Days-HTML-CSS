		<h2>Quick Tip: Create a Custom Quick Settings Tile for Android</h2>

		<p><a href="#">Siddharth</a> on Sep 23rd 2011 <a href="#">with 44 comments</a></p>

			<p>The quick settings panel needs no introduction to Android users. They use the switches it offers all the time to turn services such as WiFi, Bluetooth, and GPS on and off. Over the years, it has grown and improved so much that there's rarely a need to open the actual Settings app these days.</p>
			<p>Until recently, the quick settings panel was locked, and users had to be satisfied with a large, but fixed collection of switchesâ€”commonly known as tiles. With the launch of Android Nougat, though, that's no longer the case. Users are now free to add, remove, and rearrange tiles. What's more, as an app developer, you can offer your own custom tiles.</p>
